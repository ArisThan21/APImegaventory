Hello 

My first contact with the Megaventory API sending requests.
First i wrote the code to get familiar and understood the API,
after that i made some changes what i forgot or errors. I still make
some changes to make easier to read. You can see the Pull requests to see the changes i make,
feel free to say your opion and what do you think must be changed.
